**Topic: Statistical Methods for Heart Disease & Indicators**

**Abstract.** In the healthcare industry, understanding what factors or indicators affect a disease is an essential
part of the decision-making and problem-solving process. These indicators allow
decision-makers to identify any potential ways to reduce risk factors of future health and increase
the likelihood of disease prevention effectively (Santos et al., 2019). Likewise, RStudio is used
to assist with statistical analyses by extracting important insights using computational statistics,
machine learning, and visualizations. Hence, this project aims to improve the process of
analyzing patientsâ€™ heart disease in the healthcare industry to allow earlier detection and
avoidance of heart disease and morbidity. The objective is to create a statistical model that
classifies patients into those who will develop heart disease in the future and those who will not
based on the relevance of data variables. Essentially, the insights gained by analyzing the
statistical inference of each data variable to the target data will aid in establishing which factor or
indicator is critical in causing heart disease.

### Data Modeling: Binomial Logistic Regression
Based on the objective and dataset, a binomial logistic regression would be best suited for
regression analysis. Binomial logistic regression is a linear model where the data to be modeled
are expressed as numerical, discrete categories, for instance, refers to whether a patient has heart
disease or not as the response variable. The following are the proposed statistical modelling
technique methods and procedures:
- Select binomial distribution for probability distribution, as the response variable
indicates whether a patient will have heart disease or not based on
demographic and health indicators.
- Fit and interpret the model estimates using the training set with a binomial and
logit family link.
- Evaluate the model fit by including or excluding variables based on the
corresponding p-values of the fitted model coefficients as well as the p-values,
deviance, and residuals deviance from the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test.
- Perform hypothesis testing using Wald statistic (Chi-Square statistic) to
measure the overall model significance.
- Assess and evaluate the model using confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC
value on the testing set.
- Perform logistic regression assumption diagnostics to ensure that the
assumptions are satisfied.
