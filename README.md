**Topic: Statistical Methods for Heart Disease & Indicators**

**Abstract.** In the healthcare industry, understanding what factors or indicators affect a disease is an essential
part of the decision-making and problem-solving process. These indicators allow
decision-makers to identify any potential ways to reduce risk factors of future health and increase
the likelihood of disease prevention effectively (Santos et al., 2019). Likewise, RStudio is used
to assist with statistical analyses by extracting important insights using computational statistics,
machine learning, and visualizations. Hence, this project aims to improve the process of
analyzing patientsâ€™ heart disease in the healthcare industry to allow earlier detection and
avoidance of heart disease and morbidity. The objective is to create a statistical model that
classifies patients into those who will develop heart disease in the future and those who will not
based on the relevance of data variables. Essentially, the insights gained by analyzing the
statistical inference of each data variable to the target data will aid in establishing which factor or
indicator is critical in causing heart disease.
